**Heart Attack Risk Prediction using Machine Learning**

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and timely intervention can significantly reduce the risk of fatal outcomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient health data and predict the risk of a heart attack by classifying individuals into Low Risk and High Risk categories.
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and enable preventive care using data-driven insights.
